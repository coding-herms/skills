# Model Router — Task Decomposition & Model Selection

Break a project into independently executable tasks, rank by impact, estimate complexity, identify required capabilities, and route each task to the least expensive model that can complete it reliably. Do NOT use the most capable model — use the cheapest model that works.

## Task Routing Process

1. Identify core purpose + minimum viable functionality
2. Break work into small, independently assignable tasks
3. Identify dependencies + assign priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low/Trivial)
4. Estimate complexity (1-10 ± uncertainty)
5. Assign capability tags (+/++/+++ required, -/--/--- unnecessary)
6. Exclude models lacking essential capabilities
7. Score remaining models against task tags
8. Choose cheapest model with acceptable reliability
9. Select lowest sufficient reasoning level (Minimal/Low/Medium/High/Maximum)
10. Assign fallback model for uncertain tasks

## Priority

| Priority | Meaning | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Critical | Cannot perform core purpose, can't start, corrupts data | Won't boot, auth broken |
| High | Important capability can't be demonstrated/released | Demo path fails, deployment blocked |
| Medium | Affects most users but core usable | Unreliable common operation |
| Low | Uncommon workflows, edge cases | Rare browser issue |
| Trivial | Little effect on functionality | Docs, log wording, comments |

## Complexity (1-10 ± uncertainty)

| 1-2 Simple | 3-4 Moderate | 5-6 Complex | 7-8 Very Complex | 9-10 Exceptional |
|------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Local, deterministic, low-risk | Several conditions, solution clear | Multiple components, integration | Architectural impact, concurrency, security | System-wide redesign, novel research |

## Capability Tags

**Code:** code-generation, code-review, debugging, architecture, refactoring, testing, security, performance, concurrency, distributed-systems, frontend, backend, infra

**Tools:** terminal, repository-search, database, browser, api-use, file-editing, test-execution

**Perception:** basic-vision, advanced-vision, ui-analysis, diagram-analysis

**Reasoning:** long-context, planning, algorithmic-reasoning, multi-step-reasoning, requirements-analysis

**Communication:** documentation, concise-output, user-facing-copy, structured-data, spec-writing

Tag strength: `+++tag` essential, `++tag` important, `+tag` useful, `-tag` unnecessary, `--tag` strongly avoid

## Reasoning Levels

| Level | When |
|-------|------|
| Minimal | Mechanical edits, formatting, simple lookups, one-file changes |
| Low | Straightforward implementation, limited branching |
| Medium | Multi-file work, debugging, normal integration, moderate uncertainty |
| High | Difficult debugging, architecture, migrations, security, complex state |
| Maximum | Extensive exploration, deep planning, novel reasoning |

## Routing Formula

```
fit = complexity_fit + capability_match + tool_match + context_fit 
      - cost_penalty - latency_penalty - weakness_penalty
```

Essential capability failures override numeric score. A task tagged `+++advanced-vision` must NOT go to a model without vision.

## Escalation

Escalate when: touches more components than estimated, complexity exceeds model range, tests reveal architectural issues, missing essential capability, 2+ failures for different reasons, security/data-loss risk, context exceeds model capacity.

Escalation actions: increase reasoning level, switch to fallback, split task, create discovery task, add specialist review.

## Expected Usage

**Foreman loads this skill when:**
- First tick on a new project → decompose into task matrix
- Board is empty + NEVER-DONE audit → re-assess with model routing
- Worker selection → match task tags to model profiles above

**Legacy board conversion:** when converting existing `.coding-hermes/tasks.md` boards to this matrix format, see `references/board-conversion.md` for the 7-step bulk-conversion pattern.

**Output format (minimal skeleton — see `references/board-conversion.md` for full patterns including phase grouping, board state classification, and completed-summary treatment):**
```
Core purpose: [one-liner]
[Status line: foreman model, worker model, DuckBrain namespace, current state, tick info]
ID | Task | Priority | Complexity | Deps | Tags | Model | Reasoning | Fallback
[Phase header rows for >10 tasks spanning multiple phases — see reference]
Assumptions: [only routing-relevant ones]
Routing Notes: [explain unusual selections, per-phase rationale for full pipelines]
Execution Order: [prioritized IDs, phased for full pipelines]
Escalation Conditions: [board-state-specific — idle vs active vs full pipeline]
Completed: [phase-level summary table — collapse, don't delete]
```

**When converting existing boards**, load `references/board-conversion.md` for the full workflow including pre-scan, board state classification, task-type routing defaults, and anti-patterns.
